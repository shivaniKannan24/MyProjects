INTRODUCTION:
In this project, we aim to address security issues in homes, shops, and
offices. While traditional locks can provide a solution, there is a possibility of
unauthorized individuals opening the lock using duplicate keys. Furthermore, the
inconvenience of carrying and potentially losing keys can cause additional problems.
Although pattern-based locks can enhance security, they can still be compromised if
someone manages to guess the passwords or patterns.
To overcome these limitations, we propose using fingerprints as the key for
our advanced security lock system. By implementing this project with Arduino
NANO, we can incorporate various devices and features to maximize security levels

The design and implementation of a fingerprint-based door lock system
are customizable and flexible. This door locking mechanism is comparatively
cost-effective compared to the available lock systems in the traditional market.
Our fingerprint-based lock system offers a high accuracy rate and quick
recognition of fingerprints, enabling seamless integration with users and
providing enhanced security. Many companies are interested in adopting this
type of locking mechanism, but the existing systems on the market have very
high installation costs.
One of the main advantages of this system is its flexibility, allowing
for the implementation of several other systems. Additionally, the system is
highly secure. Fingerprints are unique, and the sensor is capable of identifying
all prints during testing.
